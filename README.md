# Weekend Gap

Weekend Gap is a responsive, zero-dependency browser simulator for a specific operational question: what can happen to synthetic AUD stablecoin redemption liquidity from Friday afternoon to Monday when the onchain ledger remains open but issuer redemption, banking, FX and Australian AUD payout windows do not fully overlap?

It is an educational tool. It uses no live market data, issuer data, account data or external services. Every scenario value is synthetic and editable. It is not financial advice.

## Open without installing anything

Double-click [standalone.html](standalone.html) to use the full simulator directly from a file. It has no server, package installation, or network dependency. Import and export JSON remain available.

Standalone files cannot make portable share links, so sharing is disabled there. Use **Export JSON** to move a scenario to another copy of the simulator.

To regenerate the single file from this source project, use Node.js 20 or newer:

```sh
npm run build:standalone
npm run build:standalone -- --check
```

The check command does not rewrite `standalone.html`; it fails when the generated file is missing or stale.

## Run with a local launcher

This project requires Node.js 20 or newer. It has no runtime dependencies and does not need package installation.

### Windows one-click launch

After installing Node.js 20 or newer, double-click `launch-windows.cmd` in this folder. It starts the loopback-only local server and opens the GUI once it is ready. Keep the command window open while using the app, then press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

### Cross-platform npm launch

```sh
npm run launch
```

The launcher opens the local GUI after the server is listening. If it cannot open a browser, it prints the local URL, normally `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server.

Use this no-browser option in a terminal-only environment:

```sh
npm run launch -- --no-open
```

To run only the server without opening a browser:

```sh
npm start
```

```sh
npm test
npm run check
```

## What is included

- A deterministic 72-hour Friday-to-Monday simulation.
- Editable AUD liquidity, reserve, issuer, bank, FX, payout and demand assumptions.
- Normal Friday, Weekend Rush and Market Stress presets.
- Immediate redeemable AUD, queued demand, effective liquidity ratio, estimated synthetic discount or slippage, and next payout time.
- An outcome summary showing total settled demand, the queue remaining at Monday 15:00, the peak queue timestamp, and the number of hourly checkpoints with a backlog.
- Play, pause and keyboard-accessible timeline scrubber.
- Canvas chart with a text-equivalent data table.
- Import and export of scenario JSON, server-mode URL-hash sharing, reset and safe local autosave.

## New in v1.2.0

Pin a baseline, then test a preset or edit an assumption. The comparison table
shows signed changes in demand, settled amount, remaining queue, peak queue, and
starting reserve. A dashed baseline queue overlays the chart.

The reserve planner finds the minimum whole-cent starting reserve needed to settle
a chosen percentage of total 72-hour demand by an hourly checkpoint. It holds all
other inputs fixed and reports unreachable targets when the nominal cap, demand
arrival, operating windows, or throughput prevent them. Apply a reachable result
to the editor, or export an analysis report containing both scenarios, changed
assumptions, target, deadline, and hourly comparison.

Baselines and planner settings stay in the tab and are not autosaved. Scenario
JSON and share links still carry only the current scenario. Analysis JSON is a
report, not an importable scenario. Reduced queues are not evidence of a better
strategy if the scenarios use different demand.

## Operating interpretation

The model only settles queued demand during an overlapping issuer redemption, bank settlement and Australian AUD payout window. When the chain is open, hourly settlement is limited by the smallest of issuer throughput, available FX depth, payout throughput and remaining AUD reserve. On weekends, the synthetic FX multiplier reduces available depth and widens the base spread. A closed issuer, bank or payout gate reduces immediate payout capacity to zero.

The model does not assert that any real stablecoin, issuer, bank, exchange, off-ramp or jurisdiction works this way. It cannot establish redemption rights, reserve quality, legal availability, market prices, actual liquidity or outcomes.

Detailed formulas, units, non-goals and limitations are in [MODEL.md](MODEL.md).

## Scenario format

Exported JSON uses this envelope:

```json
{
  "format": "weekend-gap-scenario",
  "version": 1,
  "scenario": {
    "name": "Normal Friday",
    "nominalLiquidityAud": 10000000
  }
}
```

Imports accept either the envelope or a scenario object. Values are validated and clamped to safe ranges. Server-mode shared links store the same editable scenario in the URL hash, which is not sent to the server by a browser request. The standalone file disables sharing because `file://` links are not portable; use exported JSON instead.
